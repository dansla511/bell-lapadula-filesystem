# bell-lapadula-filesystem
Project from a later security course. Program that emulates a basic filesystem with the Bell-LaPadula model of access control.

## The task
Similar to the task in [this repository](https://github.com/dansla511/python-filesystem), the goal was to emulate a basic file system
with access control being modeled after the Bell-LaPadula model.

Note: This project uses C code. C++ was used for certain actions.
